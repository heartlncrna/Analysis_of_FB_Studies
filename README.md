Analysis pipelines used for lncRNAs in fibrosis

Here, all the analysis commands used to analyze the RNA-seq data used in our manuscript can be found.
Each analysis file contains the actual commands to generate the results that were used for our study below:

Mirolyuba Ilieva, Henry E. Miller, Arav Agarwal, Gabriela Karina Paulus, Jens Hedelund Madsen, Alexander J. R. Bishop, Sakari Kauppinen, Shizuka Uchida
FibroDB: Expression Analysis of Protein-Coding and Long Non-Coding RNA Genes in Fibrosis

In principle, if all the required software products and programs (i.e., fastp, STAR, R, edgeR) are installed on your machine, it is possible to simply copy and paste the commands found in each analysis file to the Terminal to re-analyze the specified RNA-seq data used in our study.
